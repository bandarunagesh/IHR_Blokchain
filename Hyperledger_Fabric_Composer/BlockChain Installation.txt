Prerequisites: Make sure the fabric is running by executing the below commands
	docker ps
	
Step One: Creating a business network structure
	yo hyperledger-composer:businessnetwork
	Enter BlockHackers for the network name, and desired information for description, author name, and author email.
	Select Apache-2.0 as the license.
	Select org.example.sample as the namespace.
	Select No when asked whether to generate an empty network or not

Step Two: Defining a business network
	Create the org.example.sample.cto model file.
	Create JavaScript transaction logic in the file logic.js.
	Adding access control in the file permissions.acl.
	Create the query file using queries.qry

Step Three: Generate a business network archive
	Now that the business network has been defined, it must be packaged into a deployable business network archive (.bna) file.
	Commands: composer archive create -t dir -n .
	
Step Four: Deploying the business network
	After creating the .bna file, the business network can be deployed to the instance of Hyperledger Fabric.
	Commands: 
		composer network install --card PeerAdmin@hlfv1 --archiveFile blockhackers@0.0.7.bna
		composer network start --networkName blockhackers --networkVersion 0.0.7 --networkAdmin admin --networkAdminEnrollSecret adminpw --card PeerAdmin@hlfv1 --file networkadmin.card
		composer card import --file networkadmin.card
		composer network ping --card admin@blockhackers
	
Step Five: Generating a REST server
	Hyperledger Composer can generate a bespoke REST API based on a business network. For developing a web application, the REST API provides a useful layer of language-neutral abstraction.
	Commands: nohup composer-rest-server -c admin@blockhackers -n never -w true -p 3001 > rest-server.out 2> rest-server.err < /dev/null &
	Rest server can be accessed using http://localhost:3001/explorer/
